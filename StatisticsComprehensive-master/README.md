This project performs an analysis of average flight delays from 2008 to 2016 using the H2O deep learning platform with 
analysis performed in R and Hadoop. Network analysis of flights is performed along with an analysis of weather's effect on total delay. 
Shiny application can be accessed at https://r.amherst.edu/apps/ajavaid17/Comps2017Flights/FlightsExpo/ 
(half a minute waiting time and disregard red errors prompting for app authority contact). All chapter and code files are 
located in the StatComps2017 folder. For detailed information about the project, see the writeup in the FinalReport.pdf
