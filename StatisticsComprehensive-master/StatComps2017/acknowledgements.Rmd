    I would first like to thank the Amherst College Department of Mathematics and Statistics and Amherst College Department of IT for facilitating this       project. I would particularly like to thank Professor Amy Wagaman and Professor Shu-Min Liao for reviewing the project as well as offering suggestions. Additionally I would like to thank Professor Susan Wang and Professor Eunice Kim for their help and support in the Statistics Program. 
    
    I would also like to extend a big thanks to the Amherst College Department of IT. This project would not have been possible if it wasn't for        Aaron Coburn's continual assistance with setting up the Hadoop cluster and for loading the Flights dataset from 2008-2016. Additionally, I would like to           thank Andy Anderson for his continued support with the R server. 
    
    I like to thank my classmates from Advanced Data Analysis,     particularly Stephany-Flores Ramos, Jordan Browning and Levi Lee for their candid support. I wouldn't have the necessary data wrangling and analytical skills if it wasn't for     the cheery class mood created through group work with you all. I would also like to give a special acknowledgement to Muling Si and Levi Lee and their group project presentation from Advanced Data Analysis on mapping course networks for inspiring the flights network in my comps Shiny app. Additionally I would like to thank Caleb Ki. Thanks for all help in navigating Google BigQuery and Shiny and        overall for being a great project partner for Advanced Data Analysis! I would also like to thank my roommate, Jane Pierre, for being a keen audience for my shiny apps and an engaging conversationalist for the statistical chit-chats. 

    Lastly I would like to offer a huge thank you to Professor Nicholas Horton for all his support with the Hadoop and H2O machine       learning platform. Thanks for entrenching the importance of both statistical analysis and computing, git programming, collaborative learning and for      all encouragement and support with both statistics and computer science majors!
