    H2O platform was used to perform logistic regression and deep learning modeling. Three different models were performed. A simple logitistic regression was used to predict departure delay greater than 30 minutes against year, arrival delay, carrier, air time, distance, week and season. A subsequent logistic regression model was built to study influence of weather in predicting the occurrence of departure delay greater than 30 minutes against season, month, week, weekend, day, hour, arrival delay, distance and air time. Weather predictors included temperature, dewpoint, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, wind gust, precipitation, pressure and visibility. Lastly a deep learning model was built to study the influence of variables year, month, arrival delay, carrier, distance, hour, week, weekend and season in predicting departure delay greater than 90 minutes. Additionally grid and random search along with checkpoint models were developed to optimize for hyperparameters. 

  Arrival delay appeared to be the most important predictor of departure delay which is intuitive suggesting that flights that experienced arrival delay also experienced prior departure delay with a high likelihood. This result also implies that flights were possibly not able to recover from the initial departure delay leading to subsequent arrival delay. Additionally distance and amount of air time were important predictors for departure delay. Delay also appeared to be higher during the early morning hours and on weekends. The results also point to an increased trend in recent years like 2015 in comparison to years like 2008 and 2009. Additionally weather does not appear to be very important in predicting departure delay. Future studies can be performed to better inspect the influence of weather over departure delays. The influence of additional possible confounders like previous late flights on departure delays can be discussed.
